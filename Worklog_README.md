Week 1 of Nov
🔹 What did I work on?
- I went through JavaScript basics like
    declaring variables, working with loops, navigating switch & break code blocks, etc.
🔹 What did I achieve?
- Navigating and working with variables was easy. Working with basic loops was also okay for me to follow.
🔹 What didn’t go well — and what did I learn?
- I faced challenges with understanding a bit complex loops and writing out scripts. What i learnt was to keep practicing to get better especially writing out my own scripts.
🔹 Monthly highlights
- The month was hectic for me because of the following:
    - i made little time for learning
    - I did not take my time going through content
    - i needed more time to grasp all concepts properly
